        <h2>BAE graduate digital intelligence software engineer</h2>
        <p>
            I am writing to express my interest in your software engineering
            position. BAE Systems has hosted multiple stools at the University
            of Leeds and have always exhibited their development of leading-edge
            software and technology. This is where the origin of my interest in
            BAE systems emerged and I'm hopeful that this interest shall
            continue.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm confidient im a strong fit for this role. My technical
            background includes extensive experience with frontend frameworks
            such as React. My devotion however lies more in backend development
            as has more potential to graple problems related to optimisation and
            designing coherent interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em> The C# Programming Yellow Book </em> was my first introduction
            to C# during A-Level, Java was our vessel for teaching
            object-orientated programming at university. I am confident I have
            the relevant experience to grasp the languages stated for the role I
            am applying for.
        </p>
        <p>
            My academic background in Computer Science and Mathematics has honed
            my ability to translate abstract concepts into structured, logical
            solutions. Just as I have transformed theoretical hypotheses into
            formal proofs, I aim to transform business requirements into robust,
            maintainable software systems through collaboration and rigorous
            reasoning.

        <p>Thank you for reading - Adam F</p>
