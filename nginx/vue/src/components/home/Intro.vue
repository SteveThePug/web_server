            Hi, I'm Adam, thank you for visiting my website. I'm currently a 20
            something graduate looking for work. I like to game, listen to lots
            of music and occasionally watch anime.
        </p>

            Pages available can be traversed through links below. I am hoping to
            add some shrines, code-walkthoughs, live chat and page transitions
            at a later date.
        </p>

            One crossed wire, one wayward pinch of potassium chlorate, one
            errant twitch, and KA-BLOOIE!
